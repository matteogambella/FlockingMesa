# FlockingMesa

Modeling and development of the flocking model Boids on the Agent-Based Python framework MESA

Many of the studies for the implementation of Swarm Intelligence algorithms are based on the animal world, in particular on what are called 'emergent behaviors'. Flocking is one of these examples and follows the three rules illustrated by Reynolds (separation, alignment, and cohesion) in his model called Boids. For the realization of a flocking model, we used Mesa, an ABM (Agent-Based Model) framework in Python. The results were the ones hoped for: without being aware of what a group is, based on strictly local choices, the agents combine and recombine, creating the expected flocks on a global level. The formation of the flocks can be easily observed through the interactive visualization offered by Mesa.
